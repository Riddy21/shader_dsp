# OpenGL Shader Digital Audio Signal Processor

This project is an audio Digital Signal Processing (DSP) system that uses OpenGL shaders to process audio. 

## About

This project aims to leverage the power of OpenGL shaders to process audio signals. By using the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs, we can achieve high performance audio processing. This project is perfect for anyone interested in audio processing, digital signal processing, or computer graphics.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following libraries:

- [OpenGL Version 3.1](https://www.opengl.org/)
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libglew-dev freeglut3-dev g++ scons libportaudio2 mesa-utils
```


## How to Build

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. `make`
3. `./build/bin/main`

## Usage

> :warning: This is currently **WIP**, auto documentation about the API is not yet generated

## Next Steps
- Apply Multitrack support
- Allow dynamic render stage swapping
